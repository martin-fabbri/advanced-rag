    "RAG typically works without function calls. It retrieves relevant info from a pre-built knowledge base to answer your questions. However, a new development called Interactive RAG incorporates function calling. This allows the model to access and process information from external sources like databases and APIs during retrieval. This essentially gives RAG a much larger and more up-to-date knowledge pool to draw from, potentially leading to more comprehensive and relevant answers. While this approach offers advantages, it can also be slower and requires more resources."
