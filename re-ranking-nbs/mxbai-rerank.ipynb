    "### Why rerank?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking is pivotal in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, addressing critical limitations observed in initial retrieval phases, particularly within the context of semantic search. The empirical findings from the paper[1] underscore the performance degradation of language models when relevant information is positioned in the middle of long input contexts, signifying a need for effective reranking mechanisms. By employing reranking, systems can counteract the inherent weaknesses of language models in handling extensive and complex contexts, ensuring that the most contextually pertinent information, irrespective of its original position in the retrieved set, is elevated. This strategy not only enhances the precision of search outcomes by leveraging semantic embeddings but also substantially improves the model's ability to synthesize and utilize relevant information from a vast pool of candidates, thereby optimizing the performance of RAG tasks in processing intricate queries and extensive documents.\n",
